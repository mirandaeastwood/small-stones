<p>Kaie Kellough, Kevin Yuen Kit Lo, and Jason Sharp have created a stunning audio-visual experience, drawing on multiple layers (disciplines) to bring this piece to life. The following annotations represent the beginning of an attempt, not to detangle, but to identify the ways in which the audio layers of this piece interact, intersect, and intercede one another to produce a stunning poetic experience.</p>
 
 <p>Please note that these annotations focus on the auditory layers of the work only; the visual/textual aspects are not presently reflected on this page.</p>
